Milestones
Waitlist Landing Page Integration
Objective:
Add a waitlist landing page to help gather potential user interest, build anticipation, and collect early feedback for the project. This is a key step in project engagement.

Tasks:
Design Landing Page
Simple form with fields for name, email, and interest level.
Include a brief project description and benefits for joining the waitlist.
Integrate Form with Backend
Collect form submissions and store them in a database (Google Sheets, Firebase, etc.).
Launch Page
Make the page accessible to the public, ideally linking to it from social media or newsletters.

Avalanche Checkpoints
As you work on your project, here are three checkpoints that will help us assess how you're using Avalanche technology. These will be key in deciding who will be awarded the bounty:
Using Avalanche for Your Project
Make sure your project is connected to the Avalanche network. Show us how you're using Avalanche to handle blockchain transactions and why it’s the best fit for your project.
Deploying Smart Contracts on Avalanche
We want to see you deploy a smart contract on the Avalanche network! Demonstrate how you've set up and run your contract on Avalanche’s C-Chain, and explain how it works within your project.
Taking Advantage of Avalanche's Speed and Low Costs
One of the best features of Avalanche is its fast transactions and low fees. Let us know how you're using these features in your project to enhance the user experience or make transactions more affordable.
